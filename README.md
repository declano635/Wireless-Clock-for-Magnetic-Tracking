# Wireless-Clock-for-Magnetic-Tracking
This project aimed to provide a wireless clock design, suitable for implementation in an
Electromagnetic Tracking (EMT) sensor node. The wireless clockâ€™s purpose is to alleviate the
mobility constraints associated with a wired design, whilst maintaining synchronous clock function.
